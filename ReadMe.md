It is not a profesional software, is intended to be used in the classroom to study and
explore some aspects of cryptography.

If you want to download the binaries they are in _build_ folder. This
software is coded in [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29)
so you need a _JRE_ to run it (download ir [here](https://www.java.com/es/)). Contact
[rodrigovalla[at]protonmail.ch](mailto:rodrigovalla@protonmail.ch) for support.
